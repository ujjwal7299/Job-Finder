# Frontend Coding Challenge: Work & Travel Job Finder

## Overview
You are a frontend developer at Work and Travel Guide, tasked to build a job search interface that will be integrated into app.workandtravelguide.org, helping international workers find employment opportunities in Australia.

## The Goal
Create an intuitive application where users can:
- Browse available job opportunities in an intuitive list view on the left, with a visualization of the map of opportunities on the right side
- Have all the information available that they require for contacting them at a glance
- Filter companies by location and industry
- Be able to mark employers that they've already contacted (does not need to be stored permanent state. It's fine if it resets when I reload the page)

## Provided Data Structure
```javascript
const company = {
  id: 'job-123',
  email: 'hr@surfshop.com',
  state: 'NSW',
  firstName: 'Sarah',
  lastName: 'Johnson',
  phoneNumber: '+61535373443',
  companyName: 'Pacific Surf Shop',
  address: '123 Campbell Parade, Bondi Beach NSW 2026',
  latitude: -33.8915,
  longitude: 151.2767,
  industry: 'Retail & Tourism'
};
```

You'll be provided with a JSON file containing job opportunities across Australia.
